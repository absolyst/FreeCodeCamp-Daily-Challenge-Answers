from datetime import date, timedelta

def count_business_days(start, end):
    start = datetime.date.fromisoformat(start)
    end = datetime.date.fromisoformat(end)

    all_days = (start + timedelta(x) for x in range((end - start).days + 1))
    count = sum(1 for day in all_days if day.weekday() < 5)
    return count
