Extension Extractor

Given a string representing a filename, return the extension of the file.

    The extension is the part of the filename that comes after the last period (.).
    If the filename does not contain a period or ends with a period, return "none".
    The extension should be returned as-is, preserving case.

def get_extension(filename):
    extension = ""
    if '.' not in filename or filename[-1] == '.':
        extension = "none"
    else:
        extension = filename[((filename.rfind('.'))+1):]
    return extension
