Fingerprint Test

Given two strings representing fingerprints, determine if they are a match using the following rules:

    Each fingerprint will consist only of lowercase letters (a-z).
    Two fingerprints are considered a match if:
        They are the same length.
        The number of differing characters does not exceed 10% of the fingerprint length.

import string

def is_match(fingerprint_a, fingerprint_b):

    if len(fingerprint_a) != len(fingerprint_b):
        return False

    diffs = 0
    lowAlphabet = list(string.ascii_lowercase)
    for (char1, char2) in zip(fingerprint_a, fingerprint_b):
        if (char1 not in lowAlphabet) or (char2 not in lowAlphabet):
            return False 
        if char1 != char2:
            diffs += 1

    if diffs > float(len(fingerprint_a) * 0.1):
        return False
    
    return True
